          <p class="text aboutme">Timothy Hall is a current graduate student at Portland State University pursuing a MS in Computer Science with a focus on AI and machine learning. He earned a BS of Computer Science from Portland State as well.  His journey down this path began back in 2013 where he self taught himself java and was instantly hooked. Years of making small games has evolved to becoming passionate about image processing and computer vision. In 2021 he lead the development of an image classifier for Sightline Applications to identify cars and people for onboard video surveillance systems.  Tim plans to contribute to projects for the medical field or self driving cars in the future. In his free time he makes things and spend time in the outdoors.
